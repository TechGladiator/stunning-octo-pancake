// Enable application to parse file
parseFile();

// Confirm correct number of columns are present based on header row

// Prompt user with missing columns

// Use an alert modal to prompt user to correct

// Implement Bootstrap modal

// let user correct column errors if possible

// Application displays all successful records

// Append the parsed and validated data to HTML document body as a table

// Validate data type formats in each record

// Flag records that do not meet data type formats

// Implement JavaScript methods for data validation

// Highlight specific fields of records with data entry issues

// Guide user in cleaning records

// Correct errant fields or remove the record 

// i.e. “District of Columbia” instead of “DC” in the state field should be flagged and user forced to correct field, delete the record, or cancel entire process

// Once corrected, check again to ensure data type formats are met and flagged accordingly 

// Alternatives: 

// Wizard based process to do field clean up on records with problems only

// Highlight records with issues and establish a repair-next button that jumps to each record with an issue 

// Clear records that have been corrected as user goes

// Once all records are cleaned or removed, user is presented with an option to name and save the data set

// Display the name of the imported data set on the grid header or top of page
